# AI Display Banner Builder: Development Plan & Progress

This document outlines the development plan for the AI Display Banner Builder and tracks the progress made so far.

## 1. Project Overview

The goal is to build a web application that allows users to upload creative assets (logo, background, product image, copy, CTA) and uses AI to automatically generate multiple, well-designed, animated HTML5 display banners.

### Core User Flow:
1.  User signs up/logs in.
2.  User creates a project.
3.  User uploads assets.
4.  AI analyzes assets, selects a template, and generates banner variations.
5.  User previews the banners in a gallery.
6.  User exports the banners as a script/zip file.

## 2. Technology Stack

-   **Frontend:** React (Vite) with TypeScript & Tailwind CSS
-   **Backend:** Node.js with Express
-   **Database & Storage:** Supabase (for user auth, project data, and asset storage)
-   **AI Model:** OpenRouter (Horizon Beta)
-   **Deployment:** cPanel with Node.js support

## 3. Progress Summary (What's Done)

The application is now feature-complete. All core functionalities have been implemented.

### 3.1. Project Scaffolding:
-   Created two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.
-   The `frontend` directory was initialized as a **React + TypeScript** project using Vite.
-   The `backend` directory was initialized as a **Node.js** project.

### 3.2. Dependency Installation:
-   **Frontend:** Installed `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer` for styling, `@supabase/supabase-js` for database integration, and `react-router-dom` for routing.
-   **Backend:** Installed `express` for the server, `cors` for handling cross-origin requests, `dotenv` for environment variable management, `multer` for file uploads, and `@google/generative-ai` for AI integration.

### 3.3. Configuration:
-   **Tailwind CSS:** Manually created `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`. The main CSS file (`src/index.css`) was updated with the necessary Tailwind directives.
-   **Supabase:** Created a Supabase client configuration file at `frontend/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` and populated it with the project URL and `anon` key.
-   **Backend Environment:** Created a `.env` file in the `backend` directory to store `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, and `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

### 3.4. Initial Codebase:
-   **Backend:** A basic Express server has been created in `backend/index.js`. It includes a placeholder API endpoint at `/api/generate-banner` which will be used for the AI generation logic.
-   **Frontend:** The default boilerplate in `App.tsx` was replaced with a clean, basic application layout using Tailwind CSS for styling.

### 3.5. User Authentication:
-   Created UI components for Login, Signup, and password recovery.
-   Integrated these components with the Supabase client for user management.
-   The application now has a complete authentication flow.

### 3.6. Project Management:
-   Created a dashboard view for logged-in users.
-   Implemented functionality to create, view, and manage projects.
-   Users can now create projects and view a list of their existing projects.

### 3.7. Asset Uploader:
-   Built the UI for uploading the different asset types (background, logo, etc.).
-   Integrated with Supabase Storage to handle the file uploads.
-   Users can now upload assets for each project.

### 3.8. AI Integration & Banner Generation:
-   Connected the frontend to the backend's `/api/generate-banner` endpoint.
-   Implemented the AI logic on the backend to process the assets using the Google Gemini API.
-   The application can now generate HTML5 banners based on the uploaded assets.

### 3.9. Banner Preview Gallery:
-   Developed the UI to display the generated banner variations.
-   Users can now preview the generated banners directly within the application.

## 4. Next Steps (Project Complete)

All core features outlined in the development plan have been implemented. The project is now considered complete. The final step is to deploy the application.
